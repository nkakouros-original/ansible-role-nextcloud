# The major nextcloud version to install. You can use this to upgrade to a new

nextcloud_urls:
  - https://localhost:80/folder
# This is a list of urls where your nextcloud installation should be accessible.
# You would normally need only one. If you specify more than one, the first one
# will be as the "main" one, for pretty urls, etc.

nextcloud_apps: []
# Nextcloud apps to be installed, removed, enabled or disabled
# It is a list of hashes. Eg
#
# nextcloud_apps:
#   - name: calendar
#     state: enabled
#
# The action can be defined using the app's state, the following states are
# supported:
# - present: The app will be installed, the enabled status will not be changed
# - absent: The app will be removed. Only available for external apps.
# - enabled: The app will be installed if not available yet, and will be
#   enabled
# - disabled: The app will be installed if not available yet, and will be
#   disabled
#
# Installation and removal is only supported for external apps, apps shipped
# with Nextcloud can only be enabled or disabled.
# Currently, always the latest version available from the App Store is
# installed.

nextcloud_config: {}
# A yaml array with settings of nextcloud apps.
#
# Nextcloud organizes its configuration in two categories:
# - system: this category contains all basic configuration parameters for the
#           framework to operate. Its keys are stored in the `config.php` file
#           of the instance installation's `config` directory.
# - apps: this category contains settings for the individual apps as well as
#         for some core components of the framework (in `core`). These settings
#         are stored in the database directly and require a correctly
#         configured system to be accessed.
#
# For instance:
# ```
# nextcloud_config:
#   apps:
#     core:
#       backgroundjobs_mode: cron
#   system:
#     overwrite:
#       cli:
#         url: "{{ nextcloud_urls[0] | regex_replace(':[0-9]{2,5}', '') }}"
#     trusted_domains:
#       "{{ nextcloud_urls | map('urlsplit', 'hostname') | list }}"
#     htaccess:
#       RewriteBase: >-
#         /{{ nextcloud_urls[0]
#           | regex_replace('/$', '')
#           | urlsplit('path')
#           | regex_replace('^/')
#         }}
# ```

nextcloud_users: []
# The ansible users to create, other than the admin.
# It is a list of hashes. Eg
#
# nextcloud_users:
#   - name: alice
#     pass: superstrongnot
#     resetpassword: yes  # reset the passsword every time the playbook is run
#     display_name: Alice B. Charlie
#     settings:
#       - firstrunwizard:
#           show: 0
#       - calendar:
#           showWeekNr: 'yes'
#     app_config:
#       ...
#
# App and core configuration happens per user. To find out what config options
# are available, either make the changes manually and then the oc_preferences
# table in your nextcloud database or use the `occ config:list` command on your
# server to get a listing of the current configuration options.
